      'Mobile-first student portal redesign for Asian College of Technology. Features 25+ screens with clean layouts and intuitive navigation optimized for one-handed mobile use.',
    fullDescription:
      'Project Overview\n\nThis project is a mobile-first redesign of the Student Academic Management System portal for Asian College of Technology. The goal was to create a clean and easy to use interface that helps students access important services like grades, clearance status, financial information, document requests, and scholarships directly from their phones.\n\nProblem\n\nThe existing portal was difficult to use on mobile devices. Students found it hard to navigate and locate the features they needed most. The interface was cluttered and not designed for small screens, making everyday tasks frustrating.\n\nSolution\n\nI designed over 25 mobile screens in Figma that put student needs first. The new design uses a simple navigation system, clear visual hierarchy, and card-based layouts that work well on phones. Each screen focuses on specific tasks to avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once.\n\nKey Features\n\n- Login and dashboard screens optimized for 390 x 844 pixel displays\n- Quick Actions section for one-tap access to common tasks\n- Grade tracking, clearance management, and financial services pages\n- Document request system and library access interface\n- Scholarship announcements and notification cards\n- Sliding navigation pattern for smooth transitions between sections\n\nDesign Decisions\n\nI used a blue color scheme for professionalism and readability. The Inter font was chosen for its clarity on small screens. All buttons and interactive elements have enough spacing to work well with touch input. High contrast text ensures good readability in different lighting conditions.\n\nTools and Deliverables\n\nCreated using Figma with a complete design system including reusable components. The prototype demonstrates how users would navigate through different features. All screens are production-ready and include detailed specifications for developers.\n\nOutcome\n\nThis redesign shows how a mobile student portal can combine multiple services into one simple interface. The design makes complex academic tasks easier to complete on a phone and provides a foundation for future development.',

      'Open-source toolkit simplifying 2D character animation for web and mobile. Features bone rigging, keyframe interpolation, and flexible export capabilities.',
    fullDescription:
      'Project Overview\n\nThe Character Animation Toolkit is an open-source browser-based tool that makes 2D character animation easier for developers. It provides features traditionally found in expensive software, allowing users to create smooth character animations directly in their web browser and export them for use in games, websites, or mobile apps.\n\nProblem\n\nProfessional animation software is often expensive and has a steep learning curve. Developers who want to add character animations to their projects may not have access to specialized tools or animation training. This creates a barrier for teams trying to bring characters to life in their applications.\n\nSolution\n\nThis toolkit runs entirely in the browser with no installation needed. Users can create bone structures by drawing skeletal hierarchies over character artwork. Parent-child relationships ensure natural movement, so moving an arm automatically moves the connected hand. Inverse kinematics support lets animators position hands or feet and have the system calculate the correct joint angles automatically.\n\nAnimation Features\n\nKeyframe animation gives precise control over timing and movement. Users set keyframes at specific moments, and the toolkit smoothly fills in the motion between them using customizable easing curves. Layer-based timelines help organize complex animations, allowing separate control of different body parts while keeping everything synchronized.\n\nExport Options\n\nAnimations can be exported as sprite sheets, JSON data compatible with popular game engines, or video formats for web use.
